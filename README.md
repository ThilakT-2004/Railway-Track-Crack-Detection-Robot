# Railway-Track-Crack-Detection-Robot
This project presents a Railway Track Crack Detection Robot designed to enhance railway safety by automatically identifying cracks or faults on railway tracks. The robot uses an Arduino UNO/Mega as the main controller, along with various sensors and communication modules to monitor, detect, and report track conditions in real-time.
